I am happy to share some personal news: I have been selected as a JSPS Research Fellow (DC2).

This fellowship supports doctoral students in Japan and provides an opportunity to focus on research. I am grateful to those who have supported my work and offered advice along the way.

I hope to make good use of this opportunity and continue growing as a researcher.
