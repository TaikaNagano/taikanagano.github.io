The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach to bracketing paradox phenomena in the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1993). Although in English, the comparative suffix <i>-er</i> does not attach to a trisyllabic adjective, *unhappier* is exceptionally possible. Focusing on the negative prefixes <i>un-</i> and <i>in-</i>, we argue that the exceptional comparative form is attributed to the timing of prefixation of <i>un-</i>. We give some suggestive empirical evidence from the perspectives of (morpho-)phonology and semantics.
