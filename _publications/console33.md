The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach to bracketing paradox phenomena in the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1993). Although in English, the comparative suffix *-er* does not attach to a trisyllabic adjective, *unhappier* is exceptionally possible. Focusing on the negative prefixes *un-* and *in-*, we argue that the exceptional comparative form is attributed to the timing of prefixation of *un-*. We give some suggestive empirical evidence from the perspectives of (morpho-)phonology and semantics.
